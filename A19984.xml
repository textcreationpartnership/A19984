            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

               <note n="l" place="margin">Sir Thomas Moore in the Booke allea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged before in the Epistle to the Reader, <hi>Epistolae aliquot Eruditorum.</hi> p.

He not being now a Nouice, but hauing spent many yeeres in Religious Obseruances, as they call them, came at length to that Promotion, that he became the Prior of the Monastery, yet more neglecting the Precepts of God, then Monastical Rytes, &amp; Ceremonies, he fell from Vice to Vice, &amp; came at length so far, that he purposed in his mind</hi> Scelus omnium atrocissimum, &amp; supra quàm credi posset execrandum, <hi>a most outragious Villany, and much more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecrable then can be beleeued, and not a simple Villany ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but such as was fraught with many besides, as one that had fully determined to add Sacrilege to Slaughter &amp; Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricide.

And yet am I not purposed to reveale the thing it self, and I abstaine from telling their names, least some old Enuy sheuld be renewed against that harmelesse Order.

               </note> saith he, <hi>in the Scriptures betweene these two kinds of men, the Good and the Bad, but you Cursed as you are,</hi> Paleae crimina etiam Frumentis obijcitis <hi>the faults of the Chaff you obiect to the Corne it selfe, &amp; being your selues the only Chaffe, you make your boast that you are the onely Corne. Well, I advise you to read this first Psalme in Greeke, so shall you not dare to obiect as a crime to the whole world, that it taketh the part of Macarius. For thereby you may happily vnderstand what Macarius that is, that hath a part in all the Saints, who throughout all Nations are blessed in Abrahams seed.

            </p>
            <p>The other is this. When one of the Priests in <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines</hi> time, had<note n="i" place="margin">Euseb. de Vit. Const. l. <hi>4.</hi> c. <hi>48.</hi> Graecè. p. <hi>154.</hi>

            <p>Vers. 2. <hi>But his delight is in the Law of the Lord, and in his Law will he exercise himselfe day &amp; night.] Nobis initi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um bonorum, abstinentia peccatorum est.</hi> To vs,<note n="m" place="margin">Ambros. in hunc.

            <p>First for the <hi>Law</hi> of the Lord. The Latine word <hi>Lex</hi> which signifyeth the <hi>Law,</hi> is<note n="o" place="margin">Vid. Vrsin. Catech. Angl. edit. <hi>1611.</hi> p. <hi>886.</hi>
               </note> deriued from <hi>Lego,</hi> which hath two significations, <hi>namely</hi> to read, and publish, <hi>or</hi> els to choose. With the former derivation agreeth the Hebrew word <hi>Thorah,</hi> with the later <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> the Greeke. In the Hebrew the <hi>Law</hi> is called <hi>Thorah, Doctrine,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <hi>Lawes</hi> are published vnto all, that euery one may learne them. The Greeke <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, commeth from a Wotd that signifieth to diuide and distribute, and therefore the <hi>Law</hi> is so called, because it distributeth vnto euery one proper charges and functions. Now the <hi>Law</hi> as it is sometimes taken in holy Scripture for the whole <hi>Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament</hi> in generall: so sometimes againe for the <hi>Bookes</hi> of <hi>Moses</hi> only, as here in this place. <hi>Moses</hi> wrote Fiue in all, which were therefore called the LAVV, for asmuch as all the <hi>Lawes</hi> that belonged to the Iewes, <hi>Morall, Ceremoniall,</hi> and <hi>Iudiciall,</hi> were comprised in those <hi>Bookes.</hi> The <hi>Morall Law</hi> is a <hi>Doctrine,</hi> agreeing with the eternall Wisdome, and Iustice of God, discer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning things honest and dishonest, knowen by nature, and engendered in reasonable Creatures at the Creation, bin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding all the reasonable Creatures to perfect obedience, both Internall and Externall, promising the fauour of God, and euerlasting Life to those which performe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Obedience, and denouncing the wrath of God, and euerlasting Paines and Punishments vnto them, who are not perfectly correspondent thereunto. The <hi>Ceremoniall</hi> were <hi>Lawes</hi> deriued from God by <hi>Moses,</hi> concerning Ceremonies, that is, Externall solemne Actions and Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stures, which in the publique Worship of God, were to be performed, binding the Iewes vntill the comming of the <hi>Messias:</hi> that they should distinguish that People and
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:9951:28"/> the Church from others, and should be Signes, Symbols, Types, or Shadowes of spirituall Things to be fulfilled in the <hi>New Testament</hi> by Christ. The <hi>Iudiciall,</hi> were <hi>Lawes</hi> concerning the ciuill Order, or ciuill Government, or maintenance of externall Discipline among the Iewes, according to the tenour of both <hi>Tables</hi> of the <hi>Deca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue,</hi> that is, of the Order and Offices of Magistrates, of Iudgment, Punishments, Contracts, and of the distingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing &amp; bounding of Dominions, deliuered from God by <hi>Moses,</hi> for the setling and preseruing of the Iewes Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth. And these are that <hi>Law</hi> here intimated by the Prophet, and whereof he speaks so much in his 119. Psalme. It is the longest and largest Psalme in all the Booke, consisting of 176. Verses, and not one of all those Verses (on<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Secondly, where it is said, <hi>His delight is in the Law,</hi> it may very well be taken for continuall Reading the same <hi>Law.

<pb n="15" facs="tcp:9951:28"/> it becomes dull and heauy, if we accustome not our selues to reading. For as Iron if it be not vsed, gathereth rust, so the Soule vnlesse it be frequent in reading diuine Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, is surrounded with Sinne, as it were with rust.</p>
            <p>Thirdly after Reading he meditates thereupon, and therefore is it here added, <hi>And in his Law will he exercise himselfe day, and night.]</hi> Excellent things they are, that are spoken of <hi>Meditation,</hi> and it is strange what in this case Authors report euen of Bruit Beasts.

The same<note n="x" place="margin">Plin. l. <hi>10.</hi> c. <hi>42.</hi>
               </note>
               <hi>Pliny</hi> tells vs the like of <hi>Pyes,</hi> and <hi>Stares,</hi> &amp; <hi>Nigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingales:</hi> and<note n="y" place="margin">Plutarch. de Solert. Animal.</note>
               <hi>Plutarch</hi> tells of a <hi>Pye,</hi> that to learne cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Tunes which shee heard Minstrels play, waxed dumbe many dayes after. At length vpon the sodaine, she brake forth into the same Tunes which those Min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strels had playd before, to the astonishment of all that heard her, and thought she would neuer haue sung again. But to returne vnto my purpose.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Meditation</hi> is that in the Old <hi>Law</hi> which was signified by <hi>Chewing</hi> the <hi>Cud.</hi> For as there the <hi>Swine</hi> was<note n="z" place="margin">Levit. 11.7.</note> vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane to the Israelites, because it chewed not the <hi>Cud,</hi> howsoeuer it divided the <hi>Hoofe:</hi> so howsoeuer we read the Word, and divide our times to that purpose, yet vnles we <hi>Meditate</hi> thereupon, and doe as the Blessed<note n="a" place="margin">Luc. 2.51.</note>
               <hi>Virgin</hi> did, lay it vp in our hearts, as in good ground, <hi>either</hi> the wicked One commeth, and catcheth it away: <hi>or</hi> Tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>or</hi> Persecution ariseth, and by and by we are offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; <hi>or</hi> the care of this World, and the deceitfulnesse of Riches choke it, and so we become vnfruitfull. So that <hi>Meditation</hi> implyes a long time, before we come to the Perfection of Happinesse here spoken of. The very seed-time
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:9951:29"/> may teach vs that we are not to sowe and reape at once. Nay, that which comes vp suddainly, hath not only the prejudice of a Proverb against it, the effect of Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, <hi>Soone Ripe, soone Rotten,</hi> but the prejudice of Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience it selfe, the cause of that Proverbe, and that Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience vpon many in the Eyes of euery Age. <hi>Sunt aliqui quorum fructus quia minus properè, minus prosperè oriuntur.</hi> Some there are,<note n="c" place="margin">Bern.

               </note>
               <hi>Hoc opus, hic labor est,</hi> Few they are that so may be.</p>
            <p>First then let vs consider what <hi>Tree</hi> it is, is here meant, for all Interpreters are not of one &amp; the selfe same minde. Some take it to be the <hi>Oliue Tree,</hi> but <hi>Hesiod</hi> the Poet, who was so skilfull in Husbandry, sets so infamous a marke on that <hi>Tree,</hi> that of all <hi>Trees</hi> bearing fruit, a God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly man me thinks, should not in any case be like that <hi>Tree.</hi> His Noat is this, as<note n="g" place="margin">Plin. Nat. hist. l. <hi>15.</hi> c. <hi>1.</hi>
               </note>
               <hi>Pliny</hi> relateth it to vs, <hi>That to that day a man was never knowne to haue gathered the Fruit of that Oliue Tree which himselfe had planted,</hi> so late of
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:9951:32"/> growth were those <hi>Trees</hi> in his time, and so slowly came they forward. But I am of their mind who take it to bee the <hi>Palme,</hi> or <hi>Date Tree,</hi> whereof in that Land there was such plenty. <hi>Pliny</hi> speaking of the <hi>Palme,</hi> or <hi>Date Tree, It loues,</hi>
               <note n="h" place="margin">Plin. Nat. Hist. l. <hi>15.</hi> c. <hi>1.</hi>
               </note> saith he, <hi>to growe by some Riuers side, where it may haue (as it were) one foot in the water, and be ever drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king all the yeare long especially in a dry season.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, where it is said, <hi>He shall be like</hi> in the <hi>Future</hi> Tence, the <hi>Future</hi> in this place signifies the <hi>Future,</hi> and <hi>Present</hi> Tence both. It is like the Lawyers <hi>Oportebit. Verbum Oportebit, tam praesens quàm futurum tempus sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificat.</hi> The word <hi>Oportebit,</hi>
               <note n="i" place="margin">De Verb. sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nif. nu. <hi>8.</hi>
               </note> say they, signifies aswell the <hi>Present,</hi> as it doth the <hi>Future</hi> Tence. So that, <hi>He shall bee like</hi> in this place, signifies indeed, that like he is already: and then, he <hi>Is,</hi> and <hi>shall be</hi> too, what is it but a continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in that happy estate of his, without any intermission at all.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, whereas he is likened to a <hi>Tree</hi> that <hi>will bring forth his Fruit,</hi> it is apparent that here he is likened to a Fruitfull Tree. And not only here, but elsewhere, for sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome or never shall wee read in Scriptures, that a Godly man is likened to any other. And therefore S. <hi>Iohn</hi> the Baptist,<note n="l" place="margin">Mat. 3.10.</note>
               <hi>Now the Axe is laid vnto the root of the Tree, therefore every Tree which bringeth not forth good fruit is hewen downe, and cast into the fire.</hi> Concerning the <hi>Fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse Tree,</hi> it is the Masters question in the Gospell,<note n="m" place="margin">Luc. 13.7.</note>
               <hi>Why cumbreth it the ground?</hi> And though the <hi>Dresser</hi> of the <hi>Ʋineyard</hi> make answere for it, <hi>Lord let it alone this yeare also, till I shall digge about it, and doung it:</hi> yet his Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion there is (to shew his <hi>Iustice</hi> aswell as <hi>Mercy) If it beare not this yeare, then after that, thou shalt cut it downe.</hi> The <hi>Fruitlesse Figtree</hi> had not such respite, but in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in a tryce, in the twinckling of an eye,<note n="n" place="margin">Mat. 21.19.</note>
               <hi>Let no fruit grow on thee hence forward for ever:</hi> And presently the <hi>Fig-tree</hi> withered away.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, this <hi>Fruit</hi> here specified must be <hi>in due season</hi>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:9951:32"/> to, that is, such as is ripe and rellishing, and of a good and wholsome tast. <hi>Behold,</hi>

            <p>Fiftly and lastly, the <hi>Season</hi> here specified, is not so to be taken, as if now, very now were not a seasonable time of bringing forth some <hi>Fruit.</hi> Euer since we haue had the meanes to come to the knowledge of sauing Trueth, the Time and <hi>Season</hi> hath bene to Vs, nor can any man make excuse, that he hath not heard of the Gospell of Christ. For as the Apostle in like case,<note n="t" place="margin">Rom. 10.18.</note>
               <hi>Haue they not heard? Yes verely, their sound went into all the Earth, and their words vnto the ends of the World:</hi> So may we say of all Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, that as many as haue but heard the <hi>Word</hi> at any time preached to them, are answerable for the bringing forth of such <hi>Fruit</hi> as will be required at their hands.</p>

<pb n="29" facs="tcp:9951:35"/> meere naturall man absolutely Righteous in himselfe, that is to say, void of all Vnrighteousnesse, of all Sinne. But we are absolutely Righteous in Christ, saith he. So that the World must shew a <hi>Christian Man,</hi> otherwise it is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to shew a Man that is perfectly Righteous. And a litle after. There is a <hi>Glorifying Righteousnesse</hi> of men in the world to come, and there is a <hi>Iustifying</hi> and a <hi>Sanctifying Righteousnesse</hi> here. The <hi>Righteousnesse</hi> wherewith wee shall be cloathed in the world to come, is both <hi>Perfect</hi> and <hi>Inherent.</hi> That whereby we are here iustified is <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,</hi> but not <hi>Inherent.</hi> That whereby we are Sanctified, is <hi>Inherent,</hi> but not <hi>Perfect.</hi> The Prophet <hi>Abakuk,</hi> saith he, doth tearme the Iewes Righteous men, not only because being iustified by Faith they were free from Sinne, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so because they had their measure of Fruit in holinesse. Thus the Prophet here in this place, though speaking elsewhere of Men in generall,<note n="o" place="margin">Ps. 14.4.</note>
               <hi>They are all gone out of the way,</hi> saith he, <hi>they are altogether become abhominable, there is none that doth good, no not one,</hi> (which hee seemeth there to speake with reference vnto God, whose eyes are<note n="p" place="margin">Ecclus. 23.19.</note>
               <hi>tenne thousand times brighter then the Sunne,</hi> beholding all the waies of men, &amp; considering the most secret parts) yet speaking now in regard of the <hi>VVicked,</hi> who are so notoriously bad, hee acknowledgeth some that haue a measure in the Fruit of Holinesse, and a right vnto the Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of Righteous Men.</p>
            <p>Secondly, concerning the <hi>Way</hi> here, <hi>The Way of the Righteous,</hi> and <hi>The Way of the Ʋngodly,</hi> we are to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand by these <hi>Waies,</hi> Counsails, Actions, or Endeauours of the <hi>Righteous:</hi> and the Counsailes, Actions, or Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours of the <hi>Ʋngodly,</hi> for so in holy Scripture are <hi>Waies</hi> sometimes taken. Like as the Prophet Ieremy<note n="q" place="margin">Ier. 10.23.</note> speakes, <hi>I knowe that the way of Man is not in himselfe, it is not in Man that walketh, to direct his steps.</hi> Intimating thereby, that Men are fowly deceaued, if so be they suppose that the event of things, is in their own hands, for let them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:9951:36"/> never so wisely, yet if God blesse not their consultati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, all things happen vnder foot.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, by <hi>Knowing</hi> here in this place is meant ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proouing, and to be pleased with, and by intimating <hi>He knoweth not the way of the Vngodly,</hi> (for that also is here intimated) his not approouing of their Way. Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise take <hi>Knowing</hi> for that, for which commonly it is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and he knowes the way of the <hi>Wicked</hi> more then the Wicked are aware of. And therefore to them that say,<note n="r" place="margin">Ps. 73.11.</note>
               <hi>Tush, how should God perceaue it, is there knowledge in the most Highest?</hi> His answere is in another place,<note n="s" place="margin">Ps. 10.15.</note>

            <p>Fourthly, and lastly, concerning the <hi>Way</hi> of the <hi>Ʋn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly,</hi> whereas besides the intimation giuen, that it is not approued of God, it is directly here pronounced that it shall vtterly perish: <hi>Hoc eis eveniet,</hi>

            <p>THis <hi>Psalme</hi> is one of those <hi>Three</hi> that besides the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary saying of it the first day of the Moneth, is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to be read in the Church at Morning Prayer on <hi>Easter</hi> day. Why it was selected to that purpose, we shall perceiue by the Annotations, and especially the Annota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at the end of this <hi>Psalme.</hi> In the meane time suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing this <hi>Psalme</hi> to be meant of our Sauiours Kingdome, let vs consider Verse by Verse the Prophets Method in this <hi>Psalme.</hi> The Prophet then after the Description of the Enterprises of the Wicked against that Kingdome: First in the Peoples opposition, and that in the <hi>First</hi> Verse; Secondly in the Counsailes, and Endeauours of the Magistrates, and that in the <hi>Second</hi> and <hi>Third</hi> Verses, he obserueth two points: First he proposeth to them cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Conclusions: Secondly, he dealeth friendly with them by way of perswasion. The Conclusions he propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:9951:37"/> are partly in respect of the Lord, and things to bee done by his power: partly in respect of Men, and things to be taught them by the Gospell. The things to be done by the Lord power, are: First, that he litle reckoneth of these their Attempts, and that in the <hi>Fourth</hi> Verse: Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, that in time he would crush them euery one, and that in the <hi>Fift</hi> Verse. The things that by the Gospell are to be taught vnto men, are, that <hi>Christ</hi> being a King ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by the Lord himselfe, as it is in the <hi>Sixt</hi> Verse, the Lord first proclaimed it to the whole World, as it is in the <hi>Seuenth,</hi> and then endowed him with the Possession of it, as it is in the <hi>Eight</hi> and <hi>Ninth</hi> Verses. At length des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cending to perswasion, he dealeth with the Magistrates, whom it principally concerned to be wiser then the rest, and that in the <hi>Tenth</hi> Verse; First, that they would present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly serue the Lord, as it is in the <hi>Eleuenth</hi> Verse; Secondly his Anointed, that is, his onely begotten Sonne <hi>Christ Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus,</hi> whom in his owne steed he had placed ouer them, as it is in the <hi>Twelfth</hi> and last Verse.</p>

               <hi>Austen,</hi> lets in to the House, so doth the <hi>Title</hi> of a <hi>Psalme</hi> to the Vnderstanding thereof. In the <hi>Ʋulgar</hi> it is thus: <hi>A Psalme of David when he did flye from the Face of Absolon his Sonne.</hi> The Story is in the Second of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel,</hi> and is in effect to this purpose. <hi>Absolon,</hi> wicked <hi>Absolon</hi> had made against his Father <hi>David,</hi> a maine Conspiracy. <hi>Absolon</hi>
               <note n="b" place="margin">2. Sam. 15.10.</note> saith the Scripture, <hi>sent Spies throughout all the Tribes of Israel, saying, As soone as yee heare the sound of the Trumpet, then yee shall say, Absolon reigneth in Hebron. David</hi> vpon the newes hereof, fled from <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and betooke himselfe vnto the <hi>Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,</hi> at which time (as it is not vnlikely) he composed this <hi>Psalme.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Psalme</hi> is framed vnto God by way of Petition, that in regard his Enemies were so many, as it is in the <hi>First</hi> Verse; and so maliciously bent against him, as it is in the <hi>Second;</hi> and yet his Faith in God was very firme, as it is in the <hi>Third</hi> Verse; Againe in regard the Goodnes of the Lord had bene formerly such vnto him, that he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver made his Prayer vnto him, but he was heard effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, as it is in the <hi>Fourth</hi> Verse; and therefore still rely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on him with much Security, as it is in the <hi>Fift;</hi> and Confidence as in the <hi>Sixt</hi> Verse; his Petition, I say, is to God that he would now also deliuer him, as it is in the <hi>Seuenth</hi> Verse; especially, for he alone was able to effect it, as it is in the <hi>Eight</hi> Verse. And thus much of the <hi>Analysis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>VErse 1. <hi>Lord, how are they increased that trouble mee: many are they that rise against mee.]</hi> It was a memorable saying of King <hi>Solomon,</hi>
               <note n="c" place="margin">Prov. 16.7.</note>
               <hi>When a mans Wayes please the Lord, hee maketh euen his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to bee at peace with him:</hi> and it is as true againe on the contrary, that when the <hi>Wayes</hi> of a man please not the Lord, he maketh euen his <hi>Friends</hi> to be at En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:9951:52"/> with him. What wayes they were that <hi>David</hi> took, before these <hi>Troubles</hi> did befall him, is recorded in holy Writ: namely, first the <hi>Way</hi> of <hi>Concupiscence,</hi> then the <hi>Way</hi> of <hi>Adultery,</hi> next the <hi>Way</hi> of <hi>Dissimulation,</hi> afterward the <hi>Way</hi> of <hi>Murther,</hi> and how displeasing these <hi>Wayes</hi> were vnto the Lord, witnesse the Words of <hi>Nathan</hi> to <hi>David. Thou</hi>
               <note n="d" place="margin">2 Sam. 12.9.</note> saith he, <hi>hast killed Vriah the Hittite with the Sword, and hast taken his Wife to be thy Wife, and hast slaine him with the Sword of the Children of Ammon. Now therefore the Sword shall neuer depart from thy House, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause thou hast despised me, and hast taken the Wife of Ʋri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah the Hittite to be thy Wife. Thus saith the Lord, Behold I will raise vp Euill against thee, out of thine owne House, and I will take thy Wiues before thine Eyes, and giue them vnto thy Neighbour, and he shall lye with thy Wiues in the sight of this Sun. For thou didst it secretly, but I will doe this thing before all Israel, and before the Sun.</hi> Hence then that <hi>Encrease</hi> of those that troubled him: hence those <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi> that rose against him. His complaint here in this place was not of the <hi>Philistians,</hi> the <hi>Idumaeans,</hi> the <hi>Moabites,</hi> and such like, vtter Enemies to the Church of God, and consequently to himselfe, but of his <hi>Subiects,</hi> his <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,</hi> his <hi>Counsellers</hi> of <hi>Estate,</hi> all in a manner falling from him, and adoring now the Sun rising, for so they tooke <hi>Absolon</hi> his <hi>Sonne</hi> to bee. In this his speech then, and in these words, is both <hi>Admiration,</hi> and <hi>Astonishment. Admiration,</hi> for that it was strange, that such great Frends a little before, should prooue such Enemies vnto him, and grow in a tryce from one Extreame vnto another: <hi>Asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment,</hi> for that they were such as himselfe not long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, had promoted to the <hi>Honours</hi> and <hi>Dignities</hi> they did enjoy.

This it is that hee doth loue.

            </p>
            <p>First, what the Prophets meaning may here be, by say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Vp Lord,</hi> we may gather by another place. For in an<note n="m" place="margin">Ps. 44.23.</note> other of his Psalmes, speaking in these words, <hi>Vp Lord, why sleepest thou awake and be not absent from vs for ever:</hi> he may be thought to intimate that the Lord by reason of differring his Helpe, had beene as it were asleepe. And yet himselfe knewe full well, and profest it accordingly, that <hi>He that keepeth Israel</hi> (and who are the true <hi>Israel,</hi>
               <note n="n" place="margin">Ps. 121.4.</note> but the<note n="o" place="margin">Gal. 6.16.</note>
               <hi>Godly) shall neither Slumber nor Sleepe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, whereas he saith, <hi>Vp Lord,</hi> it is to be obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that he goeth not to <hi>Saints</hi> for helpe, but directly to the LORD, a point of Divinity which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> will in no wise learne. No doubt <hi>Abraham, Isaac, Iacob,</hi> and <hi>Moses,</hi> were for <hi>Saints</hi> asmuch accounted of by our Prophet, as euer <hi>Peter,</hi> and <hi>Iames,</hi> and <hi>Iohn,</hi> and the Blessed VIRGIN in the estimation of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians could haue beene, yet goes our Prophet to none of them all, but directly vnto God. <hi>I will lift vp mine Eyes to the Hills</hi>
               <note n="p" place="margin">Psal. 121.1.</note> saith he, <hi>from whence commeth my helpe. Mine helpe commeth euen from the Lord, which hath made Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen and Earth.</hi> And againe,<note n="q" place="margin">Psal. 73.24.</note>

There is to this purpose a memorable <hi>Story</hi> in the Ecclesiasticall History. <hi>Narcissus,</hi>
               <note n="q" place="margin">Euseb. Hist. Eccles. l. <hi>6.</hi> c. <hi>8.</hi>
               </note> a Bishop of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> was accused of a certaine Crime by three false Witnesses that had taken their Oathes against him. The One wished that he might perish by FIRE, if hee swore not true; The Other, that if he swore not true, his BODY might <hi>pine away;</hi> The Third, that he might loose his EYES if so be he swore not true to. It was not long after, but all <hi>Three</hi> sped accordingly. The <hi>First</hi> by reason of a litle Sparke of <hi>Fire</hi> that fell amisse, had his whole House set on fire, himselfe, and Family burnt. The <hi>Second</hi> had an incu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Disease, whereby he pined and wasted away. The <hi>Third</hi> to see both these Examples before his <hi>Eyes,</hi> wept so abundantly, as that he lost both his <hi>Eyes.</hi> And this may
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:9951:62"/> be a <hi>Smiting of the Cheek-bone</hi> here meant, and a <hi>Breaking of the Teeth,</hi> namely when such publique and notorious Calamities as these, doe light vpon our Adversaries that haue been malitiously bent against vs. <hi>One</hi> perhaps stands in the Pillory, either for thine, or some others cause; an <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> is sent vnto the Iayle; a <hi>Third</hi> holds vp his Hand at Barre, and is prosequuted so farre, as that he takes his fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well of the World in some conspicuous, and eminent Place, suppose <hi>Tyburne,</hi> or elsewhere. For likely it is, that when the Lord hath scourged thee sufficiently by thine Enemies, he will as Parents doe, <hi>Proijcere Sarmentum in Ignem,</hi> cast the Rod into the Fire, as<note n="r" place="margin">Aug. in Psal. <hi>73.</hi>
               </note> speakes <hi>S.

            <p>Or if our Enemies still liue, and make no such publique ends for Reasons best knowen to Gods al-knowing Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome: yet may they bee smitten on the <hi>Cheek-bone,</hi> and their <hi>Teeth broken</hi> an other way, as <hi>Davids</hi> Enemies here might bee, and so might <hi>David</hi> meane too. That is, God might so represse, and hamper them in such sort, as that they should haue no power at all to hurt, though their Minds perhaps should be as malevolent as euer. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nè quod Malitia non habet tantas vires, quantos conatus.

If a man should come to a Prince, and keepe such order in making his Petitions, the Prince might well thinke that either be came to aske before he knewe what hee had need of, or that he had forgotten some peece of his Suit, or that he were distracted in his vnderstanding, or some other such like cause of the disorder of his Supplication.</hi> Loe here a <hi>Prayer</hi> euen in two or three lines; &amp; after that, as it were a <hi>Lesson,</hi> namely an <hi>Instruction</hi> to his Adversaries; Lastly somewhat concerning <hi>Himselfe,</hi> namely how ioyfull in Heart <hi>Himselfe</hi> was, and secure in hauing nothing, when his Enemies had the World at will.

            <p>First, for evill Speaking, it is here cald <hi>Blasphemie,</hi> and so <hi>Blasphemie</hi> indeed is taken in diverse places of holy<note n="x" place="margin">Tit. 3.2. 1.

            <p>Besides that <hi>One Sacrifice</hi> whereof <hi>S. Austen</hi> speakes, which is most truly a SACRIFICE indeed.

            <p>As <hi>David</hi> here in this place puts them in minde of a Right <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> so likewise the Prophet <hi>Esay,</hi> or rather the Lord in that Prophet: <hi>To what purpose,</hi>
               <note n="p" place="margin">Esay. 1.11.</note> saith hee, <hi>is the Multitude of your Sacrifices vnto me. I am full of the burnt Offerings of Rams, and the Fat of fed Beasts: and I delight not in the bloud of Bullocks, or of Lambs, or of hee Goats. When yee come to appeare before me, who hath required this at your hand to tread my Courts? Bring no more vaine Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, Incense is abomination vnto me: the new Moones and Sabbaths, the calling of Assemblies I cannot away with, it is iniquitie, even the Solemne Meeting. Your new Moons, and your appointed Feasts, my Soule hateth, they are a trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble vnto me, I am weary to beare them.</hi> No doubt the Lord required al these things at their hand, even the Multitude of these <hi>Sacrifices:</hi> the burnt <hi>Offrings</hi> of <hi>Rams,</hi> the fat of fed <hi>Beasts,</hi> the bloud of <hi>Bullocks,</hi> and of <hi>Lambs,</hi> as also of he <hi>Goats,</hi> and that the <hi>Offerers</hi> thereof should tread in his <hi>Courts.</hi> No doubt the required <hi>Incense</hi> at their hands, the observation of new <hi>Moones,</hi> and <hi>Sabbaths,</hi> and solemne <hi>Meetings</hi> and appointed <hi>Feasts,</hi> but it was the <hi>Manner</hi> he misliked, not the Materials, and therefore in regard of that <hi>Manner</hi> if so bee they would mend their manners in washing themselues, and making cleane, in putting away the evil of their Doings from before his eyes, in ceasing to doe evill, and learning to doe well, in seeking iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, releeuing the <hi>Oppressed,</hi> iudging the <hi>Fatherlesse,</hi> &amp; pleading for the <hi>Widowe,</hi> it is a great Invitation, and a Promise too, that followes after,<note n="q" place="margin">Esay. 1.18.</note>
               <hi>Come now and let vs reason togither,</hi> saith the Lord: <hi>though your Sinnes be as Scarlet, they shall be as white as Snow; though they be red like Crimson, they shall be as Wooll.</hi> King <hi>Ahasuerus</hi> never held

            <p>But besides the <hi>Sacrifices</hi> to be thus made, the Prophet here enioynes them one point more, namely, <hi>To put their trust in the Lord.</hi> For as little Children when they learne to goe alone, feeling the feeblenesse of their owne Feet are taught by Nature to thrust out the Hand to the Wall, and trust to it to stay them: so in regard of our own weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and speciall acquaintance with it, <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion</hi> both, teach vs to trust to a stronger then our selues, least we vtterly miscarry.

            <p>THis <hi>Fift Psalme</hi> of <hi>David,</hi> as it is a Prayer in general, so is it a <hi>Combination,</hi> and Bundle of <hi>Prayers,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining in it many Severals, as it were so many severall Suits. Here is a <hi>Prayer</hi> for Himselfe, here is a <hi>Prayer</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst his Enemies, and here is a <hi>Prayer</hi> for the Church: or to goe more particularly to worke as we haue done in the former Psalmes, Verse by Verse, our Prophet perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth in this <hi>Psalme</hi> three severall Things; <hi>First,</hi> by the way of Preface, hee prepareth, as it were, the Heart of the Lord to giue him Audience now at this time, and that in the <hi>First,</hi> and <hi>Second</hi> Verses. <hi>Secondly,</hi> he proposeth two Things: <hi>First,</hi> his Confidence, and Trust, that he hath in the Lord, in regard whereof he will be bold to approach vnto Him, as it is in the <hi>Third</hi> Verse: <hi>Secondly,</hi> his Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and Reasons, confirming that his Confidence, drawne partly from the Persons of his Enemies, who are hated, and detested of God, as it is in the <hi>Fourth</hi> Verse; in regard whereof they shall not only not bee able to stand
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:9951:78"/> before him, as it is in the <hi>Fift,</hi> but they shall be all of them confounded, as it is in the <hi>Sixt</hi> Verse; partly from his owne Person, for that trusting in the Mercies of God, he will reverently come vnto him, as it is in the <hi>Seauenth</hi> Verse. Thirdly, he makes his Petition to God, partly to direct him in the Course of his Life, by reason of his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and that in the <hi>Eight</hi> Verse; whom he describeth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side, and out-side in the <hi>Ninth,</hi> and <hi>Tenth</hi> Verses; partly to destroy those his Enemies, as it is in the <hi>Eleauenth</hi> Verse; that so the Godly may haue comfort thereby, as it is in the <hi>Twelfe,</hi> and <hi>Thirteene</hi> Verses.

               <note n="o" place="margin">Aug. in hunc Ps.</note> saith he, <hi>for that their Eyes, that is, their Minds, are in regard of the Darknesse of their Sinnes reverberated or beaten backe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine by the Light of Truth.</hi> Gerunt secum Noctem suam. <hi>They carry their Night about with them, that is, not only the Custome of sinning more and more, but also the loue of it.</hi> We had the Phrase before in the<note n="p" place="margin">Ps. 1.6.</note>
               <hi>First Psalme,</hi> and the <hi>Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> there specified, is intimated here in this place.</p>
            <p>But the Reason is here annexed also why they shal not stand in his sight, namely for that <hi>Hee hateth all them that worke Vanity.</hi> Where first concerning <hi>Hating,</hi> if any bee inquisitiue how the Lord is said to <hi>Hate,</hi> seeing <hi>God is Loue,</hi>
               <note n="q" place="margin">1. Ioh. 4.16.</note> saith S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> and where Loue is in the Abstract, there can bee no Hating at all: hee may bee answered by<note n="r" place="margin">Zanch. de Nat. Dei, seu de diuin. Attrib. l. <hi>4.</hi> c. <hi>7.</hi>
               </note>
               <hi>Zanchius,</hi> that <hi>Hatred</hi> as it is a thing that is most com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly in Men, a <hi>Passion</hi> and Feeblenesse of the Minde, so is it not in <hi>God,</hi> nor can be, for so is it Vitious: but <hi>Hatred</hi> as it is a Purpose not to haue Mercy on the Wicked; or as it is a Decree to punish them; or as it is his Displeasure with them; so the Scriptures doe attribute it to him, and Truely and Properly it belongs vnto him. Hee maketh instance in these very words: <hi>Thou hatest al them,</hi> saith he, <hi>that worke Iniquitie,</hi> that is, thou dost not only abhorre them, but thou hast decreed to punish them, and so indeed thou doest. Is it not the Property of God to punish the Wicked, saith hee? Yes it belongs vnto his Iustice, and therefore <hi>Hatred</hi> saith he, <hi>in that Sence that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures attribute it vnto God, agreeth truly vnto God, and is properly attributed vnto Him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, concerning <hi>Ʋanity,</hi> it is that which in an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Word is cald <hi>Iniquitie,</hi> and therefore shall hee say in
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:9951:83"/> that day,<note n="s" place="margin">Mat. 7.23.</note>
               <hi>Depart from me yee that worke Iniquitie.</hi> If the Question be here asked why <hi>Iniquitie</hi> is cald <hi>Vanitie,</hi> and the <hi>Workers</hi> therof the <hi>Workers</hi> of <hi>Ʋanitie?</hi> It is therfore cald <hi>Ʋanity</hi> for that <hi>Iniquitie</hi> in it selfe is a thing of no e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steeme, and serueth to no vse. <hi>They trust in Vanity,</hi>
               <note n="t" place="margin">Esay. 59.4.</note> saith the Prophet Esay, <hi>&amp; speake Lyes, they conceaue Mischiefe, and bring forth Iniquity. They hatch Cockatrice Eggs, and weaue the Spiders Web. Their Webs shall not become Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, nether shall they couer themselues with their Workes.</hi> Nor is this spoken in that sence as those Words of the Preacher were,<note n="u" place="margin">Eccles. 1.2.</note>
               <hi>Vanitie of Vanities, saith the Preacher, Vanitie of Vanities, all is Vanitie.</hi> For <hi>All</hi> there intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to be <hi>Ʋanitie,</hi> are all Temporall and worldly Things in comparison of true Felicity, but the <hi>Vanitie</hi> here meant is absolutely by it selfe without any reference to better Things. In comparison of true Felicity, <hi>Knowledge, Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, Authority</hi> (howsoeuer Gods good Gifts) bee all of them but Vaine: but <hi>Mischiefe,</hi> and <hi>Iniquitie</hi> haue a dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per dye in <hi>Vanitie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, whereas it is here said, <hi>Thou hatest all them that worke Vanitie,</hi> the Categoricall word [ALL] shewes that he makes no difference at all, betweene <hi>King</hi> &amp; <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect, Master</hi> and <hi>Servant, Mistris</hi> and <hi>Maid, Bond,</hi> &amp; <hi>Free. Of a truth,</hi>
               <note n="x" place="margin">Act. 10.34.</note> saith S. <hi>Peter, I perceaue that God is no respec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Persons, but in every Nation he that feareth him, and worketh Righteousnesse, is accepted with him.</hi> Right so may it be said, Of a truth we may perceaue, that God is no <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specter</hi> of <hi>Persons,</hi> but in every <hi>Nation</hi> hee that feareth him not, but works <hi>Iniquity</hi> is hated of him. Which word <hi>All,</hi> in this place, is not so to bee taken neither, as if all <hi>Sinnes</hi> &amp; all <hi>Sinners</hi> were meant in generall: No, there are Sinners and Sinners of <hi>Infirmity,</hi> and there are Sinners &amp; Sinnes of <hi>Iniquity;</hi> Sinners and Sinnes of <hi>Weaknesse,</hi> and Sinners and Sinnes of <hi>Wickednesse,</hi> or <hi>Wilfulnesse.

               <note n="y" place="margin">Ps. 59.5.</note> saith our Prophet, <hi>that offend of malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Wickednesse,</hi> &amp;<note n="z" place="margin">Ps. 19.13.</note>

               </note>
               <hi>that God loued vs when as we wrought nothing but Vnrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse against him, and yet that it is said most truly here,</hi> Thou O Lord hatest al them that worke Iniquitie. <hi>For af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a marvellous and heauenly manner, hee loued vs, even when he hated vs: for hee hated vs being such as himselfe had not made. And because our Iniquity did not altogether deface his Worke, hee knewe even in every of vs to hate that which wê made, and to loue that which himselfe made.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Vers. 6. <hi>Thou shalt destroy them that speake Leasing, the Lord will abhorre, both the Blood-thirsty, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfull Man.]</hi> That <hi>Leasing</hi> is <hi>Lying,</hi> wee heard<note n="b" place="margin">Exposit. in Ps. <hi>4.2.</hi> p. <hi>93.</hi>
               </note> before. That <hi>Lying</hi> and <hi>Deceitfulnesse</hi> are both ioyned here with <hi>Blood</hi> argueth the haynousnesse of both. But of <hi>Each</hi> in their severall order.</p>
            <p>First, concerning <hi>Lying,</hi> S. <hi>Austen</hi> hath wrote two Treatises thereof, the One, <hi>De Mendacio,</hi> the Other, <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra Mendacium,</hi> both in his <hi>Fourth</hi> Tome. In the Former he shewes in that <hi>Speech</hi> no lesse then <hi>Eight</hi> Parts. I mean he makes<note n="c" place="margin">Aug. de Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dacio c. <hi>14.</hi> et c. <hi>21.</hi>
               </note> mention of <hi>Eight</hi> sorts of Lyes: The <hi>First</hi> in the way of Religion: The <hi>Second</hi> when it is hurtfull to some, and profitable to none; The <hi>Third,</hi> when it is so Profitable to some one, that it hurts another; The <hi>Fourth,</hi> when it is made vpon custome of Lying; The <hi>Fift,</hi> when it is made to please others withall; The <hi>Sixt,</hi> when vpon the demand of any man it profiteth some one, and hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth no body besides; The <hi>Seauenth,</hi> when vpon the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mande of the Magistrate it performeth as much; The <hi>Eight,</hi> when it hurteth none, and yet seemes to bee profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table for the preservation of Chastity. Now of all these he shewes that no <hi>One</hi> of them is lawfull, and often there repeats this of the Prophet here, and part of that in the <hi>Former</hi> Verse, <hi>Odisti Domine omnes qui operantur Iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatem, perdes omnes qui loquuntur Mendacium.</hi> Thou hatest

               <hi>The Heaven is my Throne, and the Earth is my Footstoole: where is the House that ye build vnto me? and where is the Place of my Rest?</hi> In regard whereof King <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi>

               <hi>Behold, the Heaven, and Heaven of Heavens cannot containe thee: how much lesse this House that I haue builded!</hi> Yet sure and certaine it is, that as out of the whole <hi>Masse</hi> of <hi>Mankind,</hi> the Lord hath reserved <hi>Some</hi> to Himselfe, whom he calleth his <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect;</hi> out of the <hi>Times,</hi> and <hi>Seasons, Some</hi> which he calleth his <hi>Sabbaths,</hi> and <hi>Solemne Feasts;</hi> out of his <hi>Servants,</hi> and <hi>Attendants, Some</hi> whom he calleth his <hi>Ministers,</hi> and <hi>Priests;</hi> out of the <hi>Goods,</hi> and <hi>Wealth</hi> of Men, <hi>Some</hi> which he calleth his <hi>Tithes,</hi> and <hi>Oblations;</hi> so out of <hi>Houses</hi> and <hi>Habitations, Some</hi> he reserueth, which he calleth his owne <hi>House,</hi> like as <hi>Iacob</hi>
               <note n="c" place="margin">Gen. 28.22.</note> prophesied long before, <hi>This Stone which I haue set for a Pillar, shall be Gods House.</hi> First then, concerning the <hi>House</hi> here specified, no doubt but the <hi>Sanctuary</hi> is thereby meant, and it is called the <hi>House</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> for that God had said, he would<note n="d" place="margin">Exod. 25.8.</note>

               <hi>where his Honor dwelt.</hi> Secondly, in that it is called here the <hi>Temple,</hi> (the <hi>Temple</hi> as yet not being built) it is by the Figure <hi>Prolepsis,</hi> or <hi>Anticipatio,</hi> and that Figure then is vsed, when a Place is called by a Name that it hath a long time after, not when formerly it is so called. As when it is said in the Book of<note n="f" place="margin">Numb. 32.9.</note>
               <hi>Nombers, Ʋenerunt in Vallem Botri,</hi> it is so said, saith<note n="g" place="margin">Aug. Locut. de Numer. l. <hi>4.</hi>
               </note> S. <hi>Austen,</hi> by the Figure <hi>Anticipatio,</hi> not because that <hi>Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> was called so, when the <hi>Israelites</hi> came thither, but for that it was so called, when the Booke was written. It is in the <hi>Originall,</hi> HEICALL, which<note n="†" place="margin">Vid.

Thirdly, in that it is called <hi>The Holy Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> it is therefore so called, for that it was set apart by Gods Ordinance, to holy Vses, and Offices. Thus the <hi>Priests,</hi> and the <hi>Altar,</hi> and the <hi>Sacrifices,</hi> and the <hi>Shew-Bread,</hi> and the <hi>Fire,</hi> and the <hi>Incense,</hi> were all of them <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> euen <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> as wicked as otherwise it was, was in

               </note>
               <hi>Qui magnam Misericordiam deprecatur, magnam Miseriam confitetur:</hi> he that sues for great <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,</hi> acknowledgeth great <hi>Misery:</hi> right so is it here in this Place, he would come to that <hi>House</hi> even vpon the <hi>Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude</hi> of Gods <hi>Mercy,</hi> to diminish thereby the <hi>Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude</hi> of his <hi>Transgressions.</hi> Sixtly, and lastly, whereas hee saith, <hi>And in thy Feare will I worship toward thy Holy Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> no doubt but that as <hi>Filiall Feare</hi> is here vnderstood, (whereof hath bene spoken<note n="l" place="margin">Exposit. on Ps. <hi>4.4.</hi> p. <hi>95.</hi>
               </note> heretofore) so a holy Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration to <hi>Prayer</hi> is intimated also, according to that of the Sonne of <hi>Syrach,</hi>
               <note n="m" place="margin">Ecclus. 18.23</note>
               <hi>Before thou prayest, prepare thy selfe, and be not as one that tempteth the Lord:</hi> or that of the Sonne of <hi>David</hi> rather,<note n="n" place="margin">Ecclus. 5.1.</note>
               <hi>Keep thy Foot when thou go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est to the House of God, and be more ready to heare, then to giue the Sacrifice of Fooles.</hi> No doubt but that of <hi>Iacob</hi> was alwayes in his Minde,<note n="o" place="margin">Gen. 28.17.</note>
               <hi>How dreadfull is this Place! this is none other but the House of God, and this is the Gate of Heauen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But how is it here said, that he would <hi>worship tôward the Temple,</hi> whereas he had said in the Words before, that he would come into the <hi>House?</hi> The Answer is, that the <hi>Temple</hi> here meant, being the <hi>Tabernacle,</hi> and the <hi>Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle</hi> hauing a <hi>Court;</hi> the Priests onely when they vsed to pray, did enter into the <hi>Tabernacle,</hi> the Rest stood without in the <hi>Court,</hi> and prayed towards the <hi>Tabernacle.</hi> Now the <hi>Tabernacle,</hi> and the <hi>Court</hi> (like as afterwards the <hi>Temple,</hi> and the <hi>Court</hi>) were both called <hi>Gods House,</hi> &amp; therefore is it here said, that <hi>David</hi> would both come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

            <p>THis is the First of those <hi>Psalmes,</hi> which are called the <hi>Seauen</hi> PoeNITENTIALL <hi>Psalmes,</hi> which in our Account are these, The 6, the 32, the 38, the 51, the 102, the 130, and lastly the 142. I say in our Account, for they are otherwise reckned in the <hi>Ʋulgar</hi> (all but the <hi>Sixt</hi>) though the <hi>Psalmes</hi> bee the same. As for example, the 32, is the 31; the 38, the 37; the 51, the 50; and so forth. The Reason is, for that the <hi>Ninth</hi> Psalme, which the <hi>Hebrewes</hi> divide into <hi>Two,</hi> namely into the <hi>Ninth</hi> and <hi>Tenth,</hi> the <hi>Vulgar</hi> Translation makes but One. But then to make vp an Hundred and Fifty, for so many there are, both with the <hi>Ʋulgar,</hi> and the <hi>Hebrewes,</hi> the 146, and the 147, which are but <hi>One</hi> Psalme with the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> the <hi>Vulgar</hi> maketh <hi>Twain.</hi> So that howsoeuer they did dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agree towards the <hi>Beginning,</hi> they accord again towards the <hi>End;</hi> Like as the <hi>Iewes</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> parted themselues in the <hi>Beginning</hi> of the <hi>World,</hi> who shall both of them ioyne againe towards the<note n="a" place="margin">

            <p>Concerning the <hi>Analysis</hi> of this Psalme, framed it is, partly by way of <hi>Petition:</hi> partly by way of <hi>Reprehension.</hi> In which <hi>Psalme</hi> the Prophet <hi>David</hi> perfourmeth two things: <hi>First,</hi> he turneth himselfe to the Lord in certaine Soliloquies vnto him: <hi>Secondly,</hi> hee turneth himselfe to his Enemies, and Expostulateth with them. <hi>First,</hi> concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Lord, he makes his Humble Petition to him, to mitigate his Punishments towards him, and that in the <hi>First, Second, Third,</hi> and <hi>Fourth</hi> Verses; <hi>Secondly,</hi> he giues the Reason: <hi>First,</hi> for if he continue them, there remaineth nothing for him but Death, which as the Case then stood was not so convenient for him, as it in the <hi>Fift</hi> Verse; <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,</hi> for they had wrought in him Repentance to the full, as it is in the <hi>Sixt</hi> and <hi>Seauenth</hi> Verses. Concerning his Enemies, hee bids them Avaunt, as it is in the <hi>Eight</hi> Verse; partly for his Prayer was heard, as it is in part of that Verse, and part of the <hi>Ninth;</hi> partly for it should bee effected what he desired of the Lord, as it is in part of the same Verse, but Principally in the <hi>Tenth.</hi> And thus much of the <hi>Analysis.</hi>

               <hi>Shall not the Iudge of all the Earth doe Right?</hi> So was it our Saviours Conclusion, that they which did sinne alike should haue like Punishment. <hi>Suppose yee,</hi>

            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Prophets</hi> Request then in this place, is to bee deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered from Punishments, not <hi>in Toto,</hi> as they say, but <hi>in Tanto:</hi> not wholy and altogether, but so farre forth as it might seeme to proceed from an angry and wrathfull Hand. <hi>With how great circumspection,</hi>
               <note n="n" place="margin">Wisd. 12.21.</note> saith the Wisdome of Solomon, <hi>diddest thou Iudge thine owne Sonnes, vnto whose Fathers thou hast sworne, &amp; made Covenants of good Promises?

            </p>
            <p>But what? Is there <hi>Indignation</hi> then, and <hi>Displeasure</hi> in the Highest? Is he subiect to <hi>Passions</hi> as we our selues are? No; the Lord is not as sinfull Man, <hi>Fury is not in mee,</hi>
               <note n="o" place="margin">Esay. 27.4.</note> saith he.

               <hi>The Father of Mercies, and the God of all Comfort.</hi> The <hi>Mercy</hi> here meant is a Commiseration over his Miseries, a Tender Compassion towards himselfe, that suffered Affliction: which how well it agreeth to God aboue, witnesse the Words of the Apostle S <hi>Paul:</hi>

            <p>By the <hi>Vexing</hi> of his <hi>Bones</hi> here the Prophet perhaps meanes not his <hi>Bones</hi> indeed, but <hi>Firmamentum Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mae vel Fortitudinem,</hi> as<note n="x" place="margin">Aug. in hunc Ps.</note> S. <hi>Austen</hi> interprets it, the very Strength of his Soule, suppose his <hi>Faith,</hi> or <hi>Hope,</hi> or so forth: <hi>Praecipuum Robur suum,</hi> as<note n="y" place="margin">Calvin. in hunc Ps.</note>

When will you bring it mee? When shall I haue it? They make as much hast as possible they may, and yet that which they with so much hast endeauour to perfourme, thy Sicknesse makes it seeme long vnto thee.</hi> But it is a good Note and fit to this purpose, which S. <hi>Austen</hi> hath vpon this Psalme.<note n="h" place="margin">Aug. in hunc Ps.</note>

            <p>First for his <hi>Soule</hi> likely ynough that his <hi>Life</hi> is meant thereby, being now (as it were) at the last cast, and vpon the <hi>Confines</hi> of <hi>Death.</hi> For howsoeuer the <hi>Soule</hi> is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times taken for that Spirituall, and best Part of Man, whereby we vnderstand, and discourse of things; some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times for the <hi>Will,</hi> and <hi>Affections,</hi> whereof the <hi>Soule</hi> is the Seat; yet here in this place considering the Sequences, it may be taken for <hi>Life,</hi> by the Figure <hi>Metanomia,</hi> for that the <hi>Soule</hi> is Cause of <hi>Life.</hi>

            <p>Secondly, where he petitioneth to be <hi>Saued,</hi> and that is the <hi>Summe</hi> of his Request, he tooke no doubt the right course in making his Repaire vnto God. For as this our Prophet acknowledgeth elswhere, that he is the<note n="n" place="margin">Ps. 17.7.</note>
               <hi>Saviour of them that put their trust in him;</hi> so the Lord saith of himselfe,<note n="o" place="margin">Esay 43.11.</note>

               <note n="b" place="margin">Ps. 88.10.</note> saith, <hi>Doest thou shewe Wonders among the Dead: or shall the Dead rise vp againe and praise thee?

               <hi>The Dead praise not thee, O Lord: neither all they that goe downe into the Silence: but we,</hi> that is, we which liue, <hi>will praise the Lord from this time forth for euermore.</hi> And yet again,<note n="d" place="margin">Ps. 30.9.</note>

And that they praise the Lord in the <hi>World</hi> to come, witnes those severall places in the <hi>Revelation,</hi> that might bee brought to this purpose.<note n="f" place="margin">Rev. 5.13.</note>
               <hi>Euery Creature which is in Heauen, and in the Earth, and vnder the Earth, and such as are in the Sea, and all that are in them heard I, saying,</hi> BLESSING, HONOVR, GLORY, AND POWER BE VNTO HIM THAT SITTETH VPON THE THRONE, AND VNTO THE LAMB FOR EVER AND EVER.

               <hi>I heard a Voyce from Heauen, as the Voice of many Waters, and as the Ʋoice of a great Thunder: And I heard the Voice of Harpers, harping with their Harpes.

            <p>THis Seauenth <hi>Psalme,</hi> whether it hath his reference to <hi>Saul,</hi> or <hi>Semei,</hi> or to any other of <hi>Sauls</hi> Kinred (in the <hi>Greeke</hi> Title there is mentioned <hi>Cush</hi> the <hi>Beniamite,</hi> as also in the <hi>Hebrew</hi>) as it is <hi>partly</hi> framed by way of Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition vnro God: so <hi>partly</hi> by way of Doctrine, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction vnto Men. <hi>Davids</hi> Prayer, and Petition to God
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:9951:110"/> is, First to haue his Assistance, as it is in the <hi>First</hi> Verse; least by reason of his Enemies he should vtterly miscarry, as it is in the <hi>Second;</hi> who falsly accused him, as it is in the <hi>Third,</hi> and <hi>Fourth</hi> Verses; which Accusations could they haue prooued, be refused no Punishment, as it is in the <hi>Fift</hi> Verse. Secondly, <hi>Davids</hi> Prayer, and Petition to God is, that God himselfe would take the matter, into his owne Hands, and shewe in his behalfe, his <hi>Seuerity,</hi> and <hi>Maiesty,</hi> as it is in the <hi>Sixt</hi> Verse; and that for their sakes who were the Godly, as it is in the <hi>Seuenth</hi> Verse. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>Davids</hi> Prayer, and Petition to God is, to justifie him, that is, to make his Innocency appeare vnto the World, as it is in the <hi>Eight</hi> Verse, that so the Vngodly may bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed, as it is in the <hi>Ninth;</hi> and the reason of this Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is, for the Lord knew <hi>David,</hi> inside, and outside, euen his inmost Thoughts, as it is in the <hi>Tenth,</hi> and <hi>Eleauenth</hi> Verses. <hi>Davids</hi> Doctrine, and Instruction to Men, is concerning Gods Iudgments, as it is in the <hi>Twelfe</hi> Verse; wherewith he punisheth the Wicked, as it is in the <hi>Thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth,</hi> the <hi>Fourteenth,</hi> the <hi>Fifteenth,</hi> the <hi>Sixteenth,</hi> and <hi>Seauenteenth</hi> Verses; and therefore is to be praised, as it is in the <hi>Eighteenth</hi> Verse.

            <p>THis <hi>Eight Psalme,</hi> beside the ordinary saying of it the <hi>First Day</hi> of the <hi>Moneth,</hi> is the <hi>First</hi> of those <hi>Three</hi> that are appointed for <hi>Morning Prayer</hi> vpon the AS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CENTION DAY. Why it was selected to that purpose will appeare in the handling thereof. In the meane time let vs consider that it wholly consisteth of <hi>Praising</hi> God, whose MAIESTIE the Prophet here extolleth, partly in respect of the whole <hi>World</hi> in generall, as it is in the <hi>First</hi> Verse; partly in respect of the <hi>Creatures</hi> therein contained. This his <hi>Maiesty</hi> very Babes and Sucklings doe seeme to acknowledge to, as it is in the <hi>Second</hi> Verse. The <hi>Creatures</hi> contained in the <hi>World</hi> are first of all those Celestiall Orbs, the <hi>Heauens,</hi> and <hi>Moone,</hi> and <hi>Starres</hi> as it is in the <hi>Third</hi> Verse; Secondly <hi>Man,</hi> whose Dignity the Prophet sheweth, partly for that the Lord had such a peculiar loue vnto him, as it is in the <hi>Fourth</hi> and <hi>Fift</hi> Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses; partly for hee gaue him <hi>Dominion</hi> ouer all things li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:9951:122"/> in the World, as it is in the <hi>Sixt</hi> Verse; whether they were <hi>Terrestriall,</hi> as it is in the <hi>Seauenth</hi> Verse; or <hi>Fowles</hi> and such as liued in the Water, as it is in the <hi>Eight</hi> Verse. The consideration whereof made the Prophet ende with the selfe same Words he did begin withall, as it is in the <hi>Ninth</hi> Verse. And thus much of the <hi>Analysis.</hi>

            <p>Secondly, for the <hi>Word</hi> affixed here, and the <hi>Pronoune [Our] O</hi> LORD <hi>our Gouernour,</hi> it may put vs in minde òf our Community that we ought to haue with one another. I meane not an <hi>Anabaptisticall</hi> Community, to haue all things Common, nor yet such a <hi>Timon-like</hi> Propriety, as to esteeme of nothing but what's our owne. <hi>God</hi>
               <note n="e" place="margin">Epistola ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quot Erudito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum. p. N. <hi>2.</hi>
               </note> saith S<seg rend="sup">r</seg> Thomas Moore, <hi>well prouided, when he instituted at the first all things Common, our Sauiour Christ provided well to, when he endeauoured to withdraw mortall Men from the Private, to the Publick. He well knew the corrupt Nature of Mortality, that is could not be enamoured of that which was Priuate, but to the Dammage, and Losse of that which was Publick</hi> It is true I haue obserued<note n="f" place="margin">Expos. on Ps. <hi>3.7.</hi> p. <hi>76.</hi>
               </note> before, that in some <hi>Caeses,</hi> as the Prophet, so we also by his example, may eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of vs say, MY GOD in Particular, but now that the Subiect of Speech is vpon Matter of <hi>Gouernment,</hi> it becommeth each in <hi>Particular,</hi> to speake thus in <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, concerning the <hi>Name</hi> of <hi>GOD,</hi> it is taken here in this place, or for the <hi>Honour, Renowne,</hi> and <hi>Glory,</hi> or for the <hi>Vertue,</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>GOD,</hi> for by these is <hi>GOD</hi> knowen, as Men are by their <hi>Names. In Iewry is GOD knowen</hi>
               <note n="g" place="margin">Ps. 76.1.</note> saith <hi>Dauid, his Name is great in Israel;</hi> but what is <hi>Iewry,</hi> or what is <hi>Israel</hi> to all the World be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides? And therefore the Apostle S. <hi>Paul,</hi> speaking of the Gentiles, <hi>The Wrath of God</hi>
               <note n="h" place="margin">Rom. 1.18.</note> saith <hi>he, is reuealed from Heauen, against all Ʋngodlinesse, and Vnrighteousnesse of
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:9951:123"/> Men; who hold the Truth in Vnrighteousnesse. Because that which may be knowen of God, is manifest in them, for God hath shewed it vnto them. For the invisible things of him from the Creation of the World are clearely seene, being vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood by the things that are made, euen his Eternall Power and Godhead, so that they are without excuse: because that when they knew God, they glorified him not as God, neither were thankefull, but became vaine in their Imaginations, and their foolish Heart was darkned.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, concerning the <hi>Excellency</hi> here of his <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, Renowne, Glory, Vertue,</hi> and <hi>Power,</hi> it were an end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse peece of Worke to describe each particular, for see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they are all of them infinite, where should we begin to speake? wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>re should we end? The best discourse can be made hereof, is to admire here with our Prophet, and to say as here is said, <hi>O Lord our Gouernour, how excellent is thy Name!</hi> Admiratio est interdum ignotâ causâ, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum, cognitâ. <hi>We sometimes admire the things whose Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses are vnknowen,</hi>

               </note> saith <hi>Scaliger, sometimes the things whose Causes are knowen well ynough.</hi> And surely all things being, come within this compasse, that either knowen they are, or not knowen. And howsoeuer the <hi>Poet</hi> say,

               <hi>S. Mathew,</hi> and<note n="o" place="margin">Luc. 7.9.</note>
               <hi>S. Luke</hi> doe both relate of him. For hearing the <hi>Centurian, He maruailed,</hi> saith <hi>S. Mathew,</hi> and said to them that followed, <hi>Verely I say vnto you, I, haue not found so great Faith, no not in Israel.</hi> Whereupon<note n="p" place="margin">Aug. de Gen cant.

            </p>
            <p>Fiftly, and lastly, where our Prophet here saith, <hi>That he hath set his Glory aboue the Heauens;</hi> the meaning is, that he is Infinite both in <hi>Maiesty,</hi> and <hi>Glory. Behold</hi>
               <note n="q" place="margin">1. King. 8.27.</note> saith Solomon, <hi>the Heauen, and Heauen of Heauens cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine thee: how much lesse this House that I haue builded.</hi>

            <p>Vers. 2. <hi>Out of the Mouthes of very Babes, and Suck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings hast thou ordeined Strength, because of thine Enemies, that thou mightst still the Enemy, and the Auenger.]</hi> As if the Prophet had here said, that God should commend his <hi>Providence</hi> to vs, he needs not the<note n="†" place="margin">Calv. in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 word">

Whence comes it, that in so few Dayes they waxe so <hi>Great,</hi> that then they grow more, then after that in some <hi>Yeeres?</hi> No doubt but in these Particulars, <hi>God</hi> hath a speciall Finger, and therefore no marvaile though <hi>Infants</hi> may well bee said to sound forth <hi>Gods Praises.</hi> And not onely so, but <hi>Vt destruas Inimicum, &amp; Vltorem,</hi> to still the <hi>Enemy,</hi> and the <hi>Avenger</hi> to, euen to put him to perpetuall Silence, in so much, that he should not haue a word to say.

            <p>Secondly, by the People of the City of<note n="t" place="margin">Sulpitius in vita. Martini. c. <hi>7.</hi>
               </note>
               <hi>Towres</hi> in <hi>France.</hi> The Story is this. About the Yeere of our Sa-<hi>Christ</hi> 370. The People of the City of <hi>Towres,</hi> vpon the Vacation of the <hi>Bishoprick,</hi> were desirous to haue <hi>S. Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin</hi> to be their <hi>Bishop, Vna omnium Voluntas, eadem Vota, &amp;c.</hi> Yet some <hi>Few,</hi> and some of the <hi>Bishops</hi> to, which were called thither, to constitute some One, or Other, were earnestly against it, saying that he was but a Man contemptible, vnworthy of a <hi>Bishoprick,</hi> a homely Man to see to, both in his <hi>Apparell,</hi> and in trimming himselfe. The more they spake against him, the People liked him the more, but who so much against him, as one <hi>Defensor</hi> by Name, but he was payd for it with a witnesse. And thus it fell out. Insteed of the Words aboue-mentioned, <hi>Ʋt destruas Inimicum, &amp; Vltorem,</hi> it was in their Translation that they vsed in those Dayes, <hi>Vt Destruas Inimicum, &amp; Defensorem.</hi> Now it so fell out, that whereas by chaunce the <hi>Reader,</hi> whose Office was to read that Day, was shut out by meanes of the <hi>Throng;</hi> and the <hi>Ministers</hi> were troubled, looking about for him that was not there, One of the Company tooke the <hi>Psalter,</hi> and read that Verse that came next to hand. The Verse of the <hi>Psalme</hi> was this, <hi>Ex Ore Infantium, &amp; Lactentium perfecists Laudem, propter Inimicos tuos, vt destruas Inimicum &amp; Defensorem.</hi> Now as soone as that Verse was read, the People made a <hi>Shout,</hi> as if S. <hi>Martin</hi> had bene meant in the Former Part,
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:9951:124"/> and the Prophet <hi>David</hi> in the Latter, had directly aimed at his Enemy <hi>Defensor,</hi> whereupon the contrary Part was cleane confounded.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, there is in<note n="u" place="margin">
                  <hi>Ruffin. Hist. Eccles l.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 3. Book of <hi>Hom. Part.</hi> 1. for Whit-Sunday.</note>
               <hi>Ruffinus</hi> a memorable Story, how the VVords of this <hi>Verse</hi> were fulfilled after a sort, though they are not applied there. The <hi>Story</hi> was this. VVhen <hi>Constantine</hi> the Emperour had caused the <hi>Clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy</hi> to come together about <hi>Arrius</hi> his Opinion, there came vnto the Assembly, <hi>Philosophers,</hi> and <hi>Logitians,</hi> that were exquisite in their Faculty, and had great Conceits of themselues. Among the rest, One there was that was famous in <hi>Logick,</hi> and euery Day hee disputed with our <hi>Bishops</hi> that were well seene in <hi>Logick</hi> to. Many very Learned, came to here and see these Conflicts. Nor could the <hi>Philosopher</hi> be put to Silence; nay hee had such <hi>Skill,</hi> that when hee was thought most of all to bee caught and taken, like a slippery <hi>Snake</hi> hee would slide away from them. But that God might shew that his Kingdome is not in<note n="x" place="margin">1. Cor. 4.20.</note>
               <hi>Word,</hi> but in <hi>Power,</hi> there was among the <hi>Bishops</hi> One of the <hi>Confessors</hi> by, a Man most simple, and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing els but<note n="y" place="margin">1. Cor. 2.2.</note> IESVS CHRIST, <hi>and him cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.</hi> Who when hee saw the <hi>Philosopher</hi> insulting vpon our Men, and boasting himselfe vpon the Skill hee had in Reasoning; desires of all that were by, to yeeld him roome, that he a little might talke with that <hi>Philosopher.</hi> Our Men that knew the <hi>Simplicity</hi> of the Man, and his vnskilfulnesse in that kind, began to Feare, and withall Blush, least that holy Simplicity of his, should happely be exposed to the <hi>Scornes</hi> of those crafty Companions. The old Man persisted in his Purpose, and thus began, <hi>O Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losopher</hi> saith he, <hi>in the Name of</hi> IESVS CHRIST <hi>heare thou those things which are true. God that made the Heauen and Earth, and gaue Man a Spirit, whom he framed of the Dust of the Earth is one: he hath by the Vertue of his Word, created all things, both Ʋisible, and Invisible, and streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened them by the Sanctification of his Spirit. This Word
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:9951:125"/> and Wisdome, whom we call the Sonne, taking pity vpon hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Errors, is borne of a Virgin, and by the Passion of his Death, hath deliuered vs from euerlasting Death, and by his Resurrection, hath giuen vs euerlasting Life. Whom we looke for, to come to be the Iudge of all we doe. O Philosopher, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuest thou this?</hi> Whereupon he, as if he had neuer learnt the Art of <hi>Contradiction,</hi> was so amased by Vertue of the Words that were spoken, that being mute to all that was alleaged, onely this he was able to answer, that it seemed so to himselfe indeed, and that there was no other <hi>Truth</hi> then what was deliuered by that Party. Whereupon the old Man, <hi>Why then, if thou beleeuest</hi> saith he, <hi>these things to bee true, arise, and follow me to the Church, and take thou Baptisme, the Seale of this Faith.</hi> Hereupon the <hi>Philosopher</hi> turning to his Disciples, or to those that there were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, and came to heare, <hi>O you Learned Men,</hi> saith he, <hi>hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken vnto me. While this Matter in hand was perfourmed by Words. I also opposed Words vnto Words, and those things which were spoken, able I was to confute them by the Art of Speaking, but now that insteed of Words, Power is procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from the Mouth of him that speaketh, neither can Words resist that Power, neither can Man withstand GOD. And therefore if any of you here present, can beleeue these things that haue bene spoken, as I my selfe doe beleeue them, let him beleeue in</hi> CHRIST, <hi>and follow this old Man, in whom GOD hath thus spoken.</hi> And so at length the <hi>Philosopher</hi> being made a <hi>Christian,</hi> was glad that hee was so vanqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed.</p>

            <p>GEntle Reader: So much white Paper now in sight, I hold it not inconvenient to take this opportunity of speaking a word or two before our parting.</p>
            <p>I told thee in the <hi>Epistle</hi> before, of certaine <hi>Bookes</hi> of mine, formerly Printed, which were not published to the World, but only bestowed on certain <hi>Frends.</hi> There haue bene misliked therin by some, <hi>Tenets</hi> for <hi>Tenents; Austen</hi> for <hi>Austin; I,</hi> for <hi>Yea; A Many</hi> for <hi>Many;</hi> and such as these. True it is <hi>Tenents</hi> is the vsuall Word, but seeing <hi>Tenents</hi> is the Plurall, and <hi>Church</hi> the Singular, why may I not say, <hi>The Churche's Tenets? Austin</hi> I grant, is deriued more fitly from <hi>Augustinus,</hi> then <hi>Austen</hi> is, seeing <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustinus</hi> hath no <hi>E</hi> in it: but no more hath <hi>Concilium,</hi> and yet we commonly write <hi>Councell.
